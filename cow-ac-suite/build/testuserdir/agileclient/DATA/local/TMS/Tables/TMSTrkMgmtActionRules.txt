# This file allows for stricter control on track management actions, DELETE,
# MERGE, ASSOCIATE, and DISASSOCIATE.  Currently, if an action's label
# (e.g. SECRET) dominates the maximum label of data received on a track or
# tracks, the action is allowed.  For example, if a DELETE action is received at
# label SECRET for a track with the maximum label of data CONFIDENTIAL, the
# action is performed.  For actions, MERGE, ASSOCIATE, and DISASSOCIATE, the
# action label must dominate the maximum label of data for both tracks specified
# in the action.
#
# It should be noted that the same track could exist in TMS databases at
# different labels and the maxiumum label of the data for the track in those
# databases could be different.
#
# The following format is used to specify stricter controls on a per label basis
# for track management actions:
#
# ACTION:LABEL=RULE:LABEL=RULE:
# ...
#
# Valid ACTION values are DELETE, MERGE, ASSOC, and DISASSOC and must only be
# specified once if at all.
#
# Valid rules are ONLY or BELOW.  ONLY means the action will take place only in
# the TMS Db of the LABEL the action is received.  BELOW mean the action will
# take place only in the TMS Dbs at the LABEL of the action and below.
#
# Valid LABEL values are defined in the label encodings file
# (/etc/security/tsol/label_encodings).
#
# Example
#
# DELETE:SECRET=BELOW:CONFIDENTIAL=ONLY:
# MERGE:TOP SECRET=ONLY:
# ASSOC:
# DISASSOC:
