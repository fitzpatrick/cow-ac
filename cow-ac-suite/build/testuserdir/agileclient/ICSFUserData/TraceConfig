# Trace.out and Trace.err can be directed a file or not:
#   If there is a filename present output is directed to it

# Examples: "Trace.out.file: /tmp/Trace.out.txt" (UNIX)
#           "Trace.err.file: c:\\tmp\\Trace.err.txt" (Windows)

# If CLASS_PACKAGE is selected, a package path is required.
# Enter the package path: e.g. 'disa.ifl.ui.printer' or 'navy.cce.routes'.
# All classes in that package will be traced.
